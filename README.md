# Event Bank

A hacky little bank app for creating accounts, depositing funds, making withdrawals. Built to play around with event sourcing architecture.

Caveat: I don't really know what I'm doing. The purpose of this project was to hack my way through building some simple commands using event sourcing in order to wrap my head around the concepts, before going off and looking at popular implementations or frameworks. _Wheeeee!_
